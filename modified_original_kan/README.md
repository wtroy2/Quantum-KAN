#  THIS IS A MODIFIED VERSION OF THE ORIGINAL PYKAN REPO. FOR THE ORIGINAL PYKAN PLEASE GO TO: https://github.com/KindXiaoming/pykan
## Install
To install the qkan package through pip you can simply run the following steps:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install .
```

This will allow you to import and run qkan in python. Note that grid was removed as it doesnt have the same applicability when using the Bezier function as the basis function for a KAN.
Along with this the k variable was changed to degrees. This allows for different degrees of the Bezier function on different layers of the KAN.
